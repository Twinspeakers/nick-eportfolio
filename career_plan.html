                <h4>Be aware</h4>
                <p>What actions can you take to really understand your interests, values, skills, personality and strengths?</p>
                <p>Leveraging online tools devoted to personal analysis can help me to fine tune my understanding of my place in the world. The Ikigai model is of particular interest to me as it is simplistic in nature, but still offers a hollistic approach to self discovery, prioritising human passion and fulfillment as highly as it does resourcefulness and usefulness to society. I would seek to harness this model and to gradually build on it throughout the progression of this course, taking advantage of online tools and quizzes as each opportunity to do so arises.</p>
                <p>A willingness to engage in group settings will lead to a higher sense of identity and connectedness. The courage to make mistakes followed by the capacity to identify their causes and alter decision making thereafter will mitigate growth and lead to resourcefulness. Humility and the accepting of ideas from the people around me will help to diversify my knowledge and lead me to be open to directions that I would not have considered otherwise. Taking note of the courses that I enjoy and excel in will be an appropriate navigator to the direction I am heading in.</p>
            </li>

                <h4>Explore your options</h4>
                <p>What do you need to research to be clear about your options? What could you do to learn more about career options in your areas of interest?</p>
                <p>As a University student, career counselling services are available and can help me with course selection. Any elective classes that could be of hidden benefit can be found through the process of exploring my interests, strengths and aspirations, and the help of a trained professional can greatly enhance decision making in this area.</p>
                <p>Advances in technology are a good indicator of future demand in different industries. Paying attention to the progression and innovation of tools used in the job can provide a competitive edge moving forward. For example, in the case of Accountancy, advances in artificial intelligence will inevitably see the industry shift away from a more data entry based approach and become more focused on critical thinking and creative insights through the evolution of available tools.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Gain experience and insight</h4>
                <p>What actions could you take to help you learn more about your industry or find opportunities to develop your skills or find work experience opportunities?</p>
                <p>Paying attention to industry trends help to make informed decisions in an ever-changing world. Joining relevant groups on social media platforms and attending industry events are good ways to become immersed in the industry, make contacts and better understand the specific roles and responsibilities in the chosen field. Current job opportunities on jobseeker platforms such as Seek or LinkedIn are a valuable resource as they illustrate key skills necessary to maximise performance.</p>
                <p>Practical settings are often the best way to grow ideas and hone skills. Becoming physically emmersed with the world you wish to be a part of instills a sense of reality and belonging, and is a key indicator of whether or not you're in the right place. Internships are possible gateways into the industry and are available through the University, and this is one direction I will be actively seeking.</p>

                <p>What action can you take to find out more about what skills you might need to develop in your future career? How might you document/record these?</p>
